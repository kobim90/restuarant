DB:
1. install mySQL (write down the user and password)
in mySQL:
2. select Server at the top bar
3. select Data Import
4. tick the "Import from Self-Contained File
5. pick the file "restuarant.sql" (comes inside the zip)
6. refresh the SCHEMAS tab on the left.
7. you should be able to see the DB in the SCHEMAS bar

(if anything doesnt work I attached a sql query script that 
creates a db when run inside mySQL named: "Create resturant DB script.sql")

server:
1.install git Bash
2.open git Bash in a folder of your choosing
3.write "npm init"
4. write "git clone https://github.com/kobim90/restuarant.git"
5. open the terminal in root folder and write "npm install"(in any IDE you choose)
6. go to the DAL folder api.js file and in line 3 change the user and password to match
the details of your mySQL user/password.

notes:
*example of a working order recieved by the server from the client: 
{
    "data": {
        "customerId": "12",
        "orderDate": "2021-9-1",
        "orderCity": "Ramat Gan",
        "orderAddress": "HaEshel 1",
        "products": [{"productId": "1", "quantity": "1"}, {"productId": "2", "quantity": "1"}]
    }
}
*currently working productIds are 1-5 (DB is filled with 5 products)
* to run testing in terminal write "npm test"
*to start the server write "npm start" in root folder terminal
*the GET route return the orders of the current date, so in order to see results, you must enter orders from the date you
are checking the project
