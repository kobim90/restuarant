DB:
1. install mySQL (write down the user and password)
in mySQL:
2. select Server at the top bar
3. select Data Import
4. tick the "Import from Self-Contained File
5. pick the file "restuarant.sql" (comes inside the zip)
6. refresh the SCHEMAS tab on the left.
7. you should be able to see the DB in the SCHEMAS bar

(if anything doesnt work I attached a sql query script that 
creates a db when run inside mySQL named: "Create resturant DB script.sql")

server:
1. open the terminal in root folder and write "npm install"
2. go to the DAL folder api.js file and in line 3 change the user and password to match
the details of your mySQL user/password.

    }
